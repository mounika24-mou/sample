<p class="font-weight-bold"> Nikhil is a struggling businessman who thinks he loves Karishma, an actress. Nikhil is characterized as a person who believes that once committed to a girl, there should be no straying. Nikhil asks Karishma's father to help him with ₹50 million (US$700,000) before marriage to earn a contract. But Karishma and her father insult him as he often renders money shamelessly. Thus putting him in a position to prove himself without them lending the amount.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-4 bg-warning">
        <p class="font-weight-bold">  Then Nikhil meets Meeta, Karishma's younger sister, whom he had a brief encounter with seven years ago. Meeta, an IITian in Chemical Engineering and PhD., is a super-intelligent geek with unusual habits and tics, who ran away seven years ago to China after stealing money from her father, leading to his heart attack. Now, just a week before Nikhil and Karishma's wedding, Meeta has turned up to meet her father, but Karishma is scared that her sister's sudden appearance might ruin their wedding. Hence, Karishma assigns Nikhil to keep Meeta away from her father.</p>
    </div>
<div class="col-4 bg-secondary">
<p class="font-weight-bold">Meeta has returned, intending to steal again, but her involvement with Nikhil during the next seven days diverts her attention. During these seven days, with many personal and social activities, Nikhil and Meeta fall in love, but Nikhil backs off as he doesn't want to betray Karishma. He comes to know that for her research, Meeta has taken a hefty loan of ₹100 million (US$1.4 million) from a Chinese investor by forging her father's signature. The deadline for payback is over, and an extension of three days was given, during which she has to steal money from her father's account to save him from the investor's goons</p>
